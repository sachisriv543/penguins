## Data

The Palmer Penguins dataset was made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) Network. The package includes 2 datasets, one raw, and one modified, to aid in data visualization. More information is available at this link: <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/>

<br>

Let's install and load the Palmer Penguins package.
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
view(penguins)
```

## Single trait distribution

Now we are ready to visualize the distribution of a single trait. Let's look at the density distribution of bill sizes among the three species surveyed at Palmer Station.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(bill_length_mm, fill = species), alpha = 0.5) + 
    facet_wrap(~species, nrow=3)
```

Let's also see how these traits overlap.

```{r}
ggplot(penguins) +
  geom_density(mapping = aes(bill_length_mm, fill = species), alpha = 0.5)
```

## Sexual dimorphism
